## 🏌️‍♂️ About Me
- I am currently a Senior Software Engineer in the Civil Service
- When I'm not developing software, you'll find me on the Golf Course ⛳ , Playing Music 🎸 or training JiuJitsu 🥋

## ☎️ How to Contact Me
- There is nothing better that talking face to face
- Voice or video calls are the next best thing
- I am always happy to receive messages on Teams or Slack
- I would prefer to only use email for formal communications where possible

## 👨‍💻 Preferred Working Style
- I am very flexible with my work, I am happy to work as early or late as needed
- All I ask is there is a chance for me to do a bit of exercise each day
- I work well in groups, happy to facilitate discussions or present to larger audiences
- I enjoy pair and mob programming however I am also happy to go it alone

## 🙂 What Motivates Me
- The idea of learning something new! Growth is always a good thing
- Seeing direct business benefit
- Seeing others improve as a result of my support and mentoring

## 🥱 What Demotivates Me
- Repetitive, tedious tasks
- Working on a product with no access to customers/stakeholders

## 💙 My Values (and what I value in others)
- Honesty 
- Transparency 
- A 'Work Hard' work ethic

## 👨‍🦯 My Blind Spots
- I sometimes find it hard to delegate to those I have not built up trust with. I make it a priority to build trust with those around me to mitigate this

## 😠 My Pet Peeves
- Not giving others a chance to be heard. Everyone's voice is valuable and those that don't allow others to speak cant be a detriment to the team
- Guessing... sometimes... when people make things up when they don't know an answer rather than looking to the room for additional knowledge
